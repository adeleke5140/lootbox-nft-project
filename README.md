# NFT Lootbox Project.

Pointer offers a great tutorial on how to build NFTs and hook that up to a custom quiz. 

One challenge I gave myself was not to copy any code. I typed every piece of code line by line.
I did this because I wanted to understand. Understand what each Line did and their role in the general app.

A lot of things were not quite clear because I am not a TS or Blockchain expert. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful learning experience.

I played around with TS, React, NextJS, Tailwind, thirdWeb sdk, Polygon Testnet, Metamask.
